stringex
========

Some [hopefully] useful extensions to Ruby's String class. It is made up of acts_as_url, unidecode, and the generic sounding string_extensions libraries.


Examples
=======

TK. In the meantime, check out the test suite which has examples [are tests examples?] of their usages.


Thanks & Acknowledgements
=========================

If it's not painfully obvious, acts_as_url is based on Rick Olsen's permalink_fu[1] plugin. unidecode is a Ruby port of Sean Burke's Text::Unidecode[2] module for Perl. And, finally, the bulk of String#strip_html was stolen from Tobias -Fünke's- Lütke's Regex in Typo[3].
